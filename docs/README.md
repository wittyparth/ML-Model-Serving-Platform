## üé§ Quick Interview Prep Checklist

Before any interview, review these in 30 minutes:

### **‚òëÔ∏è The Elevator Pitch (2 minutes)**
"I built an ML Model Serving Platform that lets users deploy trained models via REST API. It's like Heroku for ML - users upload `.pkl` files and get prediction endpoints. Tech stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis. Handles 100+ concurrent users with sub-200ms response times."

### **‚òëÔ∏è Three Key Technical Decisions**
1. **FastAPI:** Async performance + auto-documentation
2. **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance + JSONB flexibility
3. **Redis:** Sub-millisecond caching (70%+ hit rate)

### **‚òëÔ∏è Biggest Challenge**
"Model loading and caching strategy - implemented lazy loading + LRU cache to balance memory and performance."

### **‚òëÔ∏è Architecture Diagram**
Practice drawing on paper in < 3 minutes:
```
Client ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí PostgreSQL
                 ‚Üí Redis (cache)
                 ‚Üí File Storage (models)
                 ‚Üí Inference Engine
```

### **‚òëÔ∏è One Code Example**
Prepare to explain JWT authentication or prediction caching (see INTERVIEW_PREP.md Q19)

## üìä Key Metrics to Remember

**Performance:**
- API response time: p95 < 200ms
- Prediction latency: 50-300ms (model dependent)
- Cache hit rate: 70%+
- Database queries: p95 < 50ms

**Scale:**
- Current: 100 concurrent users
- Can scale to: 10,000 with horizontal scaling
- Database: PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Cache: Redis cluster

**Security:**
- JWT tokens (30 min access, 7 day refresh)
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
- HTTPS only in production
