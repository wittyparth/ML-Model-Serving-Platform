## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. **Type, Don't Copy-Paste**
Typing code helps you remember it. Copy-paste = forgotten in 10 minutes.

### 2. **Break Things on Purpose**
- Remove a line - what error do you get?
- Change a value - does it still work?
- Delete a file - what breaks?

### 3. **Use the `/docs` Endpoint**
FastAPI auto-generates API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- See all endpoints
- Test them directly in browser
- Understand request/response formats

### 4. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
Error messages tell you:
- What went wrong
- Where it happened
- Often how to fix it

### 5. **Use Tools**
- **VS Code**: Best Python IDE
- **Postman**: API testing
- **DBeaver**: Database GUI
- **Docker Desktop**: Container management

### 6. **Keep Notes**
Write down:
- Concepts you learn
- Errors you fix
- Patterns you discover

5. Try `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`

### "How long will this take?"
- **Full project, full-time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Full project, part-time**: 6-8 weeks
- **Just learning concepts**: 1-2 weeks
- **Interview prep**: 1 week
