## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Testing Stack
```yaml
Framework: pytest 7.4.3
Coverage: pytest-cov 4.1.0
Async Support: pytest-asyncio 0.21.1
HTTP Client: httpx 0.25.2
Database: PostgreSQL 15 (test isolation)
```

### Test Patterns Used
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)**
2. **Fixture-based setup/teardown**
3. **Database transaction rollback**
4. **Dependency injection**
5. **Test client with overrides**

### Database Test Strategy
```python
# Session-scoped database creation
# Function-scoped data cleanup
# Transaction isolation per test
# Automatic cleanup after each test
```
